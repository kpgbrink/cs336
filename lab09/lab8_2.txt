a.
    i. React lets you break the UI into a component hierarchy and put them together.
       This makes it easier to make bigger applications and has good scalability.
   
   ii. JSX adds XML syntax to JavaScript and makes React more elegant.

  iii. Comments are loaded with loadCommentsFromServer using ajax.
       They are created with a commentBox and are saved by writing to 
       comments.js.
  
   iv. props are immutable and they are components of configuration. A Component
       cannot change its props but it is responsible for putting together props of child Components.
       states are muttable. State is able to be changed by Component.
b.
    i. When I edit a comment or delete it the comment is updated on the client. This happens because there is a poll interval of 2000. 
       So every 2000 miliseconds it pulls from the server and updates the client.
       
   ii. It uses ReactDOM.render with a pollInterval of 2 seconds. 
       So it displays when it is first shown and updates the dom every 2 seconds. 
       
  iii. If a component is changed the DOM should also changed. If a component does not represent the state then what is displayed is not known. 
  
   iv. Optimism is not foolish because it is expected that the comment will work and it will make posting feel instant instead of laggy. 
       If the server rejects the comment then after it is displayed it will be deleted.
